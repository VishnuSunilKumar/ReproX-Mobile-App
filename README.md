## ReproX: Smart Xerox Management App


ReproX is a fully functional mobile application designed to streamline the printing process at my collegeâ€™s Xerox center. The app was developed to address common issues such as long queues, payment delays, and inefficiencies in print request handling.

## Key Features:

âœ… Seamless File Upload: Students can upload their documents directly through the app.

âœ… Custom Print Preferences: Options to select page size, color, copies, and more.

âœ… Online Payment Integration: Eliminates cash transactions and reduces delays.

âœ… Real-time Order Tracking: Students can monitor the status of their print requests.

âœ… Efficient Admin Portal: Staff members manage print orders, track requests, and ensure smooth processing.


## Tech Stack:
Frontend: React

Backend: Firebase

ReproX significantly enhances the efficiency of the college Xerox center by reducing wait times and automating the request-handling process. The admin portal, which allows staff to manage print requests, is available on my GitHub:[ GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/VishnuSunilKumar/xerox-center-app)

This project demonstrates my ability to develop practical, user-friendly solutions for everyday problems using modern web technologies. ðŸš€
